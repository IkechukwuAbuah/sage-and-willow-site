## Problem Statement Section

**70% of Nigerians die without a will.**
**50% of Canadians are in the same position.**

### Body Copy
Estate planning is hard. Cross-border planning is harder. And honestly? It feels like planning for death when what you really want is to protect life—your family, your assets, your wishes.

You've built a life that bridges two countries. Your property in Lagos. Your home in Toronto. Traditions from your grandparents. Dreams for your grandchildren.

Who understands all of that?

### Pull Quote
*"I kept putting it off. Not because I didn't care, but because every service felt like it was designed for someone else's life."*

## Solution Section: Meet Your Companions

### Section Headline
**Two guides. One conversation.**

### Intro
Sage and Willow aren't forms to fill out or chatbots to interrogate you. They're AI companions—each with their own wisdom—who guide you through legacy planning like wise friends.

---

### Sage
*Your guide through what matters*

Sage doesn't rush. They ask the questions that matter most: What do you want to be remembered for? Who needs protecting? What traditions should live on?

Sage understands Nigerian family structures, cultural expectations, and the weight of legacy. They help you clarify your values before diving into details.

**Sage handles:**
- Values and wishes
- Family dynamics
- Cultural traditions
- Legacy messages
- The "why" behind your plan

*"Before we discuss the details, let's step back. When you imagine your grandchildren learning about your life—what do you hope they know?"*

---

### Willow
*The one who keeps track of everything*

Willow is grounded, thorough, and patient. Once you've clarified what matters with Sage, Willow helps you organize the practical details—assets in two countries, documents, digital accounts.

Willow knows Canadian and Nigerian legal requirements. They help you capture everything so nothing falls through the cracks.

**Willow handles:**
- Asset inventory (Canada + Nigeria)
- Property and investments
- Digital legacy (accounts, passwords)
- Legal requirements
- The "what" and "where" of your estate

*"I see you mentioned property in Lagos. Let's make sure we have the details right. What's the address, and do you have the certificate of occupancy?"*

## How It Works Section

### Headline
**Planning that fits your life**

### Step 1
**Start with Sage**

No forms. No pressure. Just reflective questions about what matters to you. Take 10 minutes or an hour—Sage works at your pace. This is where you clarify your values, family dynamics, and cultural wishes.

### Step 2
**Organize with Willow**

Once you know what matters, Willow helps you capture the details. Assets in Canada and Nigeria. Bank accounts. Property. Digital accounts. Willow is thorough, patient, and never forgets a detail.

### Step 3
**Your wishes become documents**

Together, Sage and Willow organize everything into a structured plan. But we don't stop there—licensed professionals review your documents to ensure they're legally sound.

### Step 4
**Update anytime**

Life changes. Your plan can too. Return whenever you need to—your companions remember your story and pick up right where you left off.

## Why Sage and Willow Section

### Headline
**Built for lives that bridge two worlds**

### Differentiators

#### Cultural Intelligence
We don't just acknowledge your Nigerian heritage—we understand it. Sage knows the weight of family expectations, the significance of traditional rites, and how to honor your culture within a legal framework.

#### Dual Jurisdiction Expertise
Canada and Nigeria have very different legal systems. Willow helps you navigate both—so your Toronto condo and Lagos property are both protected.

#### Conversation, Not Forms
Most estate planning feels like bureaucracy. Sage and Willow feel like talking with friends who happen to know a lot about wills, trusts, and traditions.

#### Memory That Persists
Your companions remember your story across sessions. No starting over. No explaining your family tree again. Your context stays with you.

#### Human Review Built In
AI helps you think and organize. Humans review the legal details. You get the best of both—wisdom and verification.
