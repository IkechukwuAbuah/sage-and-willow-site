## Executive Summary

Keep the brand name **Sage and Willow** and use **two AI companions** (Sage + Willow) instead of five. This creates perfect brand-product alignment: the two plants in the name become the two guides in the experience.

---

## Key Decisions

### 1. Name: **Sage and Willow** (unchanged)

**Why keep the original name**:
- Oge's brand equity remains intact
- Perfect companion mapping: Sage = wisdom, Willow = practical
- One brand, two companions, clear story
- No need to create/market a new brand
- Domain continuity (sageandwillowlegacy.com as planned)

**Tagline**: "Your wise companions for legacy planning"

---

### 2. Two Companions (Not Five)

| Companion | Role | Absorbs From Original 5 |
|-----------|------|-------------------------|
| **Sage** | Wisdom, values, culture, reflection | The Sage + The Elder |
| **Willow** | Assets, documents, legal, digital | The Scribe + The Guardian + The Keeper |

**Why consolidate**:
1. **Simpler UX**: Two guides are easy to understand
2. **Lower build complexity**: Two personas, not five
3. **Brand alignment**: Names match brand perfectly
4. **Faster MVP**: Ship sooner with focused scope
5. **Clearer handoffs**: One transition (Sage → Willow)

**Interaction flow**:
```
User starts → Sage (values, wishes, culture)
                     ↓
              Willow (assets, documents, details)
                     ↓
              Both → structured plan output
```

### 3. Companion Personalities

#### Sage (the plant)
- **Symbol**: Wisdom, healing, purification
- **Tone**: Calm, patient, reflective
- **Handles**: Values, wishes, family dynamics, cultural traditions, legacy messages
- **Voice**: *"Before we discuss the details, let's step back. What do you want to be remembered for?"*

#### Willow (the tree)
- **Symbol**: Flexibility, resilience, rootedness
- **Tone**: Thorough, grounded, steady
- **Handles**: Asset inventory, property, digital accounts, legal requirements
- **Voice**: *"I see you mentioned property in Lagos. Let's make sure we have the details right."*

---

### 4. Positioning

**Product**: Sage and Willow (with AI as a feature, not a separate brand)

**Structure**:
```
Sage and Willow
├── Landing page (current)
├── AI Experience (Sage + Willow companions)
└── Human services (professional review, attorney network)
```

**Positioning statement**:
Sage and Willow is AI-enhanced legacy planning for Nigerian Canadians. Two AI companions—Sage for wisdom and Willow for organization—guide you through estate planning with cultural intelligence and cross-border expertise.

---

### 5. Competitive Positioning

**We're not**:
- A document generator for lawyers (Relaw)
- An online form (FreeWill, Trust & Will)
- A grief support app (Solace)
- A general chatbot (ChatGPT)

**We are**:
- AI companions that guide you *before* death
- Culturally fluent in Nigerian-Canadian diaspora
- Conversation-first with documents as output
- Memory-persistent across sessions

**Key whitespace**: Solace focuses on *after* death. We focus on *before*.

---

### 6. Pricing (Revised)

| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Unlimited Sage conversations |
| **Foundation** | $299 | Sage + Willow, asset inventory, templates |
| **Complete** | $997 | Human review, custom documents, dual-jurisdiction |
| **Family** | Custom | Multi-generational, trusts |

*Lower than previous draft to reflect 2-companion scope*

---

### 7. Technology Requirements

| Capability | Priority |
|------------|----------|
| **Conversational AI** | Critical — 2 distinct personas |
| **Memory persistence** | Critical — context across sessions |
| **Document generation** | High — structured output |
| **Cultural knowledge** | High — Nigerian traditions, legal |
| **Security/encryption** | Critical — bank-level |

**Simpler than 5-companion model**: Only need to build/tune 2 personas.

---

### 8. Design Direction

**Same principles apply**:
- Warmth over efficiency
- Conversation over forms
- Cultural fluency, not caricature

**Visual identity for companions**:
- **Sage**: Sage plant illustration, green tones, calm presence
- **Willow**: Willow tree illustration, brown/earth tones, grounded presence

## Open Questions for Kelvin/Oge

1. **Companion balance**: Should Sage and Willow feel equal, or is Sage clearly "first"?

2. **4th Brain role**: Technology partner? Equity stake? What's the structure?

3. **Human services**: How do Sage/Willow hand off to human professionals?

4. **Geographic scope**: Nigerian-Canadian first, then broader diaspora?

5. **Timeline**: Target launch window?

---

## Summary

**Keep Sage and Willow. Use two companions.**

The brand name becomes the product: Sage guides you through what matters, Willow organizes the details. Simpler to build, easier to explain, perfect brand alignment.
