## The Vision

What if legacy planning felt like a conversation with wise companions rather than filling out forms?

**4th Brain Flavor**: Apply the multi-agent, persistent memory, knowledge graph approach to end-of-life planning. AI companions that remember your story, understand your culture, and guide you through decisions with empathy.

## Core Concept

### The Problem (Same as S&W)
- Estate planning is emotionally difficult
- Cross-border complexity (Canada-Nigeria) adds friction
- Cultural nuances often missed by generic services
- People procrastinate because it feels like "death planning"

### The AI Enhancement
- **Conversational interface**: Talk through your wishes, AI structures them
- **Companion personas**: Different guides for different aspects
- **Memory persistence**: AI remembers your context across sessions
- **Cultural intelligence**: Built-in understanding of Nigerian traditions
- **Knowledge graph**: Your life, assets, wishes - connected and organized

## Potential Companion Personas

| Persona | Role | Tone |
|---------|------|------|
| **The Sage** | Wisdom, big-picture questions | Calm, reflective, asks "why" |
| **The Scribe** | Asset organization, details | Practical, thorough, organized |
| **The Elder** | Cultural traditions, burial rites | Warm, respectful, traditional |
| **The Guardian** | Legal guidance, jurisdiction help | Clear, careful, protective |
| **The Keeper** | Digital legacy, passwords, accounts | Tech-savvy, secure, modern |

## 4th Brain Share/Involvement

Potential structures:
1. **Technology partner**: 4th Brain provides the AI infrastructure, S&W handles domain expertise
2. **Spin-off brand**: New brand under same umbrella
3. **Feature set**: AI companions as premium tier of S&W
4. **Separate venture**: Independent with licensing arrangement

---

## Research Questions

1. What AI estate planning tools exist? How do they position?
2. How do users feel about AI in sensitive/emotional contexts?
3. What's the regulatory landscape for AI-assisted legal documents?
4. How do grief/companion AI apps build trust?
5. What pricing models work for AI-enhanced professional services?

---

## Design Principles

1. **Warmth over efficiency**: This isn't about speed, it's about comfort
2. **Guide, don't replace**: AI companions assist, humans decide
3. **Cultural fluency**: Nigerian traditions baked in, not bolted on
4. **Privacy sacred**: Estate data is deeply personal
5. **Progress, not pressure**: People move at their own pace
