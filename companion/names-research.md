## Executive Summary

After exploring 25+ naming options, the recommendation is to **keep "Sage and Willow" as the brand** and use **Sage and Willow as the two AI companion personas**. This creates perfect brand-product alignment: the two plants in the name become the two guides in the experience.

---

## Final Recommendation: Sage and Willow (unchanged)

**Brand**: Sage and Willow
**Product**: Sage and Willow AI (or just "Sage and Willow" with AI as a feature)
**Tagline**: "Your wise companions for legacy planning"

### Why Keep the Original Name

1. **Brand equity**: Oge's existing concept, no need to fragment
2. **Perfect companion mapping**: Sage = wisdom/reflection, Willow = practical/grounding
3. **Simplicity**: One brand, two companions, clear story
4. **Cultural neutrality**: Works broadly while allowing cultural customization
5. **Domain continuity**: sageandwillowlegacy.com (as planned)

## The Two Companions

| Companion | Role | Tone | Personality |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Sage** | Wisdom, reflection, values, big-picture questions | Calm, patient, asks "why" | The philosopher - helps you clarify what matters |
| **Willow** | Practical details, assets, documents, organization | Thorough, grounded, steady | The organizer - helps you capture and structure |

### Why These Two Work

**Sage (the plant)**:
- Symbol of wisdom, healing, purification
- "Sage advice" = wise counsel
- Reflective, contemplative energy
- Handles: values, wishes, family dynamics, cultural traditions, legacy messages

**Willow (the tree)**:
- Symbol of flexibility, resilience, rootedness
- Graceful but strong, bends without breaking
- Grounding, practical energy
- Handles: asset inventory, documents, digital legacy, jurisdictional requirements

### Interaction Model

```
User starts → Sage (always first)
              ↓
    "Let's understand what matters to you"
              ↓
    Values, wishes, family context established
              ↓
         Willow joins
              ↓
    "Now let's organize the details"
              ↓
    Assets, documents, specifics captured
              ↓
    Both collaborate → structured plan output
```

**Key insight**: Sage handles the emotional/values layer, Willow handles the practical/organizational layer. Together they cover the full journey without overwhelming complexity.

## Why 2 Companions (Not 5)

### Original 5-Companion Model
| Persona | Role |
|---------|------|
| The Sage | Wisdom, big questions |
| The Scribe | Asset organization |
| The Elder | Cultural traditions |
| The Guardian | Legal guidance |
| The Keeper | Digital legacy |

### Consolidated 2-Companion Model
| Companion | Absorbs |
|-----------|---------|
| **Sage** | The Sage + The Elder (wisdom + cultural) |
| **Willow** | The Scribe + The Guardian + The Keeper (assets + legal + digital) |

### Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Simpler UX**: Two guides are easy to understand, five are confusing
2. **Lower build complexity**: Two personas to develop, not five
3. **Clearer handoffs**: One transition point (Sage → Willow), not multiple
4. **Brand alignment**: Names match the brand perfectly
5. **Faster MVP**: Ship sooner with focused scope

### What's Lost (Minimal)

- Distinct "Elder" persona for cultural wisdom → Sage absorbs this
- Distinct "Keeper" for digital → Willow handles as part of assets
- Specialized voice for each domain → Trade-off for simplicity
